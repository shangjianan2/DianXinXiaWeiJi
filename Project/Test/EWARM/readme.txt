 - project .ewd/.eww/.ewp: A pre-configured project file with the provided library 
                           structure that produces an executable image with IAR 
                           Embedded Workbench.

 - stm32l1xx_flash.icf : This file is the IAR Linker configuration file used to 
                         place program code (readonly) in internal FLASH and data
                         (readwrite, Stack and Heap)in internal SRAM. 
                         You can customize this file to your need.

 - stm32l1xx_flash_extsram.icf : This file is the IAR Linker configuration file 
                                 used to place program code (readonly) in internal 
                                 FLASH and data (readwrite, Stack and Heap)in 
                                 external SRAM.

 @par How to use it ?

 - Open the Project.eww workspace.
 - In the workspace toolbar select the project config:
     - STM32L1XX_MD(STM32L1xxxBxx): to configure the project for STM32L Ultra Low Power Medium-density devices.
                                    You can use STMicroelectronics STM32L152-EVAL board to run this project. 

     - STM32L1XX_MDP(STM32L1xxxCxx): to configure the project for STM32L Ultra Low Power Medium-density Plus devices.
                                    You can use STMicroelectronics STM32L152C-Discovery board to run this project.

     - STM32L1XX_HD(STM32L1xxxDxx): to configure the project for STM32L Ultra Low Power High-density devices.
                                    You can use STMicroelectronics STM32L152D-EVAL board to run this project.

     - STM32L1XX_XL(STM32L1xxxExx): to configure the project for STM32L Ultra Low Power XL-density devices.
                                    You can use STMicroelectronics STM32L152xE-Nucleo board to run this project.
