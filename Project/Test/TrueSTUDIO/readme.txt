 @par Directory contents
 
 - .cproject/.project: A pre-configured project file with the provided library
                       structure that produces an executable image with TrueSTUDIO.

 - STM32L1xxxx_FLASH.ld: This file is the TrueSTUDIO linker script used to 
                         place program code (readonly) in internal FLASH and
                         data (readwrite, Stack and Heap)in internal SRAM. 
                         You can customize this file to your need.
                                                          
 @par How to use it ?

 - Open the TrueSTUDIO toolchain.
 - Click on File->Switch Workspace->Other and browse to TrueSTUDIO workspace 
   directory.
 - Click on File->Import, select General->'Existing Projects into Workspace' 
   and then click "Next". 
 - Browse to the TrueSTUDIO workspace directory and select the project: 
     - STM32L1XX_MD(STM32L1xxxBxx): to configure the project for STM32L Ultra Low Power Medium-density devices.
                                    You can use STMicroelectronics STM32L152-EVAL board to run this project. 

     - STM32L1XX_MDP(STM32L1xxxCxx): to configure the project for STM32L Ultra Low Power Medium-density Plus devices.
                                    You can use STMicroelectronics STM32L152C-Discovery board to run this project.

     - STM32L1XX_HD(STM32L1xxxDxx): to configure the project for STM32L Ultra Low Power High-density devices.
                                    You can use STMicroelectronics STM32L152D-EVAL board to run this project.

     - STM32L1XX_XL(STM32L1xxxExx): to configure the project for STM32L Ultra Low Power XL-density devices.
                                    You can use STMicroelectronics STM32L152xE-Nucleo board to run this project.

 - Rebuild all project files: Select the project in the "Project explorer" 
   window then click on Project->build project menu.
 - Run program: Select the project in the "Project explorer" window then click 
   Run->Debug (F11)
