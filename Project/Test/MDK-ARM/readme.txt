 @par Directory contents
 
 - Project.uvproj/.uvopt: A pre-configured project file with the provided library structure
                          that produces an executable image with MDK-ARM.

Enabling "Options for Target 'Output' Browser Information" is useful for quick 
source files navigation but may slow the compilation time.
 
 
 @par How to use it ?
 
 - Open the Project.Uv2 project
 - In the build toolbar select the project config:
     - STM32L1XX_MD(STM32L1xxxBxx): to configure the project for STM32L Ultra Low Power Medium-density devices.
                                    You can use STMicroelectronics STM32L152-EVAL board to run this project. 

     - STM32L1XX_MDP(STM32L1xxxCxx): to configure the project for STM32L Ultra Low Power Medium-density Plus devices.
                                    You can use STMicroelectronics STM32L152C-Discovery board to run this project.

     - STM32L1XX_HD(STM32L1xxxDxx): to configure the project for STM32L Ultra Low Power High-density devices.
                                    You can use STMicroelectronics STM32L152D-EVAL board to run this project.

     - STM32L1XX_XL(STM32L1xxxExx): to configure the project for STM32L Ultra Low Power XL-density devices.
                                    You can use STMicroelectronics STM32L152xE-Nucleo board to run this project.

 - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all target files
 - Load project image: Debug->Start/Stop Debug Session
 - Run program: Debug->Run (F5)
